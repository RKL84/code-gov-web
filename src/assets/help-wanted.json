The end result is that once you've scrolled down within such an element, clicking on the visible labels triggers a click on the incorrect invisible input, which hasn't scrolled due to being position: absolute.\n\n(I recognize that overflow scroll is generally not preferred, but in a web application context we have a constraint that may require its use.)\n\nI believe a simple fix would be to add position: relative to one of the suggested ancestors of radio inputs. From the sample code in the docs, it looks like that might be .usa-fieldset-inputs, though I'm not sure if that would have any unintended side effects.",
